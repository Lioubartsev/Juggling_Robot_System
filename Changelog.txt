1.0 LQR and LQG done

0.95
ROBOT IS JUGGLING WATERFALL! LRQ done!

0.93 
Added a throw function which is ok for waterfall 1 ball.
However the system seems to weak to throw high enough for an extra ball.

0.92 
Patched the motor parameters (they were wrong)
InvLQR seems to be fully functional and complete.

0.9
The LM-LQR is now rewritten as a function which closes the LQR loop!

The EE is broken again it seems.

0.81
- Low level re-tuned
- LM works?
- EE fixed and set as subsystem

0.8 
The "naive" lqr does not work :/

The LM method works internally, however there seems to be something off with the transformation matrix since it does not correlate exactly to the model.

Looking at the response time for the model the low level controllers need to be retuned.
